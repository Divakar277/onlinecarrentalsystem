PROBLEM & SOLUTION:
Existing System:

R&D cabs is an innovative thought to simplify the Transportation problems of Employees of an organization. In the present System, Organization do maintain a person for
the allocating and proper functioning of transportation .The Person appointed needs to look after the assigning and movement of cabs. Authorised person maintains the transportation details in papers, which is a tedious task if any updation or changes need to be done.

➢ Details are stored in Papers.

➢ Maintenance is a huge problem.

➢ Updation, changes in details is a tedious task.

➢ Performance is not achieved up to the requirements.

Proposed System :

In the Previous System, Details are Stored Manually in papers to share the details between employees was a Financial drawback. Updations in the details is a tedious
task. But a new system was proposed to overcome the above drawbacks. 

Functionalities and advantages of proposed system are:
